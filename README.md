# Cryptography Project

This project demonstrates cryptographic techniques using Python, including:
- Symmetric encryption with AES.
- Asymmetric encryption with RSA.
- Digital signatures for data integrity.
- Hybrid encryption for secure key exchange.

Techniques Where these can be used :
  Generate RSA keys for the sender and receiver.
  
  Use hybrid encryption to securely exchange an AES key.
  
  Encrypt and sign data using AES and digital signatures.
  
  Decrypt and verify the data on the receiver's side.
